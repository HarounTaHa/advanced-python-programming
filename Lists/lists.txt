of lists a list is a form of variable that can be used to hold an array of object tops.

For example suppose any of multiple separate values that you want to be contained within one variable.

You use a list.

A great example would be to create a variable to contain the daughter of a person.

Let's say the first name the last name and the age you then create a list variable and place the values

within.

Note that lists can be analyzed and daughter retrieved using indexing and sluicing index in its last

late and this cause and practice thereafter.

For now binman that lists can be very useful daughter containers for any program of collecting large

amounts of data that need to be divided into various sections to create a list in path one is as follows.

As you'll notice from the line we start off the creation of the list variable as we would any other

variable.

We tap in the name of the variable follow it with an equal symbol and then we place the values.

When creating a list we open a set to square brackets and begin to place our values within.

We separate each value with a comma and with that in mind your notes are placed full values within this

list here.

Ha.

The first and John being the last list of fantastic variables to be used when processing strings of

text those words more often than not that is exactly what they are used for.

Of course you could also use a list to contain any doorstop as long as they are separated with a comma.

Here we have another example that contained within our two values one is string and the other an integer

from this we can see a list can hold more than one daughter to pass on.

It's a truly fantastic language and it's breaking down and storing values in a list.

Easy.
